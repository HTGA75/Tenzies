## About This Project

This is a simple dice-based game built with React, designed to provide a fun and interactive experience. The objective of the game is to roll the dice and achieve a specific goal (e.g., matching numbers or reaching a target sum). Once you win, a confetti animation celebrates your success, adding a satisfying conclusion to the game.

### Features:
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Roll dice and aim for the winning condition.
- **Confetti Celebration**: Enjoy a confetti animation upon winning.
- **Built with React**: Utilizes React's component-based architecture for a dynamic user experience.
- **Modern Frontend Tools**: Developed with the Vite build tool for fast and efficient development.

This project serves as a great example of integrating animations and React state management for building engaging user interfaces.
